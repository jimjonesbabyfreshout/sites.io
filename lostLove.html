<p>I could call your name on end,<br />
But you’ll never hear me.</p>

<p>I could ask a million questions,<br />
But I
‘ll never get the answer I want.</p>

<p>I could write a hundred poems,<br />
But you would still never understand.</p>

<p>I could have said it before it was time to leave,<br />
But I said it in a little note.</p>

<p>I could try to forget what I feel,<br />
But I
‘ve pushed too much out already.</p>

<p>I could lie to myself,<br />
But lying exhausts the soul.</p>

<p>I could give up on you,<br />
But too much of me still loves you.</p>

<p>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.</p>

<p>The night is shattered<br />
and the blue stars shiver in the distance.
‘</p>

<p>The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.</p>

<p>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br />
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.</p>

<p>Through nights like this one I held her in my arms<br />
I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.</p>

<p>She loved me sometimes, and I loved her too.<br />
How could one not have loved her great still eyes.</p>

<p>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br />
To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.</p>

<p>To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.</p>

<p>And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.</p>

<p>What does it matter that my love could not keep her.</p>

<p>The night is shattered and she is not with me.</p>

<p>This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.<br />
My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.</p>

<p>My sight searches for her as though to go to her.<br />
My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.</p>

<p>The same night whitening the same trees.<br />
We, of that time, are no longer the same.</p>

<p>My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.</p>

<p>Another‘s. She will be another‘s. Like my kisses before.</p>

<p>Her voice. Her bright body. Her infinite eyes.</p>

<p>Love is so short, forgetting is so long.</p>

<p>Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms<br />
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.</p>

<p>Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer<br />
and these the last verses that I write for her.</p>
